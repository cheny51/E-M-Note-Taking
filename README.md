E&M-Note-Taking

Author: Aiden Chen

Purpose:
    This repository is created to help store the notes that I have been taking while I am not in school studying. I hope the notes I take can help preparing me to study classes relating to electromagnetic theories and RF.

The textbooks that I used to grab my notes on are:
1. Ulaby's textbook
2. Intro to E&M
3. E/W 101
4. FW1 Lectures
5. Reinhold Ludwig's and Gene Bogdanov's RF circuit design

Software I used to make my notes on:
1. VS CODE's LaTex Workshop (with compiler TexLive)
